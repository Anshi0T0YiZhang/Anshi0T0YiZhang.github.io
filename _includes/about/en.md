Hey, I'm Ajiao, a science and technology worker, a football enthusiast, and a young man who doesn't move at an angle.

My life footprints are all over Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Qingdao, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Hefei. In some places, I stayed for four or five years because of studying or working; In some places, for work or play, the stay time can only be counted in days.

I like history and have read a lot of articles and books about the Three Kingdoms, the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the history of the Ming Dynasty, and the history of Japan's Warring States period. I like football, I used to be a fanatical fan of Shaanxi National Strength, and I am still a fan of Serie A Rome. Love life and love all good things.

Here, I would like to share my work, life and study, as well as the bits and pieces that are worth cherishing.
